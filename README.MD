# RonyKit 
RonyKit provides the abstraction layer for creating a cluster aware API server. By defining separate 
components for each task, you are almost free to develop your API server using RPC (Proto/JSON/...),
REST, GraphQL or even with your in-house defined protocol. However, some components are implemented
in the 'std' which make it easy to use RonyKit out of the box.
